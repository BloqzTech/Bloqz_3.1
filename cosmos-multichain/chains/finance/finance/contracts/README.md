## Components

### Finance Interfaces

- `IFinanceContract`: Extends base interchain contract with finance features
- `IFinanceValidator`: Defines financial data validation
- `IFinanceAudit`: Defines audit logging requirements
- `IRiskAssessment`: Defines risk assessment functionality

### Main Contract

The `FinanceContract` implements finance-specific features:
- Transaction processing
- Fee calculation
- Compliance validation
- Risk assessment
- Cross-chain integration

### Transaction Handler

The `FinancialTransactionHandler` manages:
- Payments
- Transfers
- Investments
- Loans
- Document management
- Multi-chain notifications

## Key Features

1. Compliance:
   - KYC verification
   - AML checks
   - Risk assessment
   - Regulatory compliance

2. Transaction Management:
   - Multiple transaction types
   - Fee calculation
   - Payment processing
   - Cross-chain settlement

3. Security:
   - Transaction validation
   - Risk assessment
   - Audit trails

## Usage

1. Initialize the contract:
```go
validator := NewFinanceValidator()
auditor := NewFinanceAuditor()
risk := NewRiskAssessor()
contract := NewFinanceContract(validator, auditor, risk)
```

2. Create a transaction handler:
```go
txHandler := NewFinancialTransactionHandler(contract)
```

3. Process financial transactions:
```go
req := FinancialTransactionRequest{
    TransactionID: "tx123",
    FromAddress: "sender456",
    ToAddress: "receiver789",
    Amount: sdk.NewInt(1000000),
    Currency: "USD",
    TxType: Payment,
}

err := txHandler.InitiateTransaction(ctx, req)
```

## Cross-Chain Integration

The contract integrates with:
- Real Estate chain for property transactions
- Insurance chain for premium payments
- Retail chain for merchant services

Each interaction includes proper validation, compliance checks, and risk assessment.
